# Exercise 3: Data Frame Calculations


# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100)


# Create a vector of 2014 salaries using the runif function


# Create a vector of 2015 salaries that are typically higher than the 2014 salaires, but not always


# Create a data.frame `salaries` by combining the vectors you just made


# In `salaries`, change the name of Employee 1 to your name. Did you get an error?



# Create a column `got.raise` that is TRUE if the person got a raise


# How many employees got a raise?


# What was the average salary increase?


# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


### Bonus ###

# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?

# Is that what you expected them to lose?

### Double Bonus (answers not provided) ###

# Repeat the above experiment 100 times, tracking the loss each time.
# Does the average loss equal what you expect?
# What about 10,000 times?
